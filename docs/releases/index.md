    **InvenioRDM is NOT production ready yet!** We plan to release the first long-term support (LTS) release in July 2021, until then InvenioRDM should not be used for running production services.

We aim to have a monthly to bi-monthly release cycle, with certain releases designated as **long-term support** releases that are suitable for production services. Our aim is to ensure that users of InvenioRDM follows our latest releases by making the upgrade process a seamless experience.
